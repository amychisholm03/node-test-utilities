provisions of Sections 3, 4.3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.3, and 10 shall survive
termination of this Agreement.
10. GENERAL.
10.1. Governing Laws. This Agreement and any disputes relating to the services
provided hereunder shall be governed and interpreted according to each of the
following laws, respectively, without regard to its conflicts of law
provisions: (a) the laws of the State of California, if You are located in

purported assignment of this Agreement without obtaining written consent shall
be void and of no effect.
10.3. Severability; Enforcement; No Waiver. The unenforceability of any
provision or provisions of this Agreement shall not impair the enforceability
of any other part of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement shall
be deemed invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, this Agreement shall
be deemed amended to delete or modify, as necessary, the invalid or
unenforceable provision to render it valid, enforceable, and, insofar as
possible, consistent with the original intent of the parties. The failure of a
party, at any time or from time to time, to require performance of any
obligations of the other party hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver and shall
not affect its right to enforce any provision of this Agreement at a subsequent
time.
10.4. Entire Agreement; Amendments; Waivers. This Agreement constitutes the
entire understanding and agreement of the parties, whether written or oral,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and

technical data (collectively “Controlled Technology”) that is subject to the
U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and diversion contrary to U.S.
law is prohibited. You agree to comply with all relevant laws including the
U.S. EAR and the laws of any country from which Controlled Technology is
exported. All Controlled Technology is prohibited for export or re-export to
Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Sudan and Syria and to any country or its nationals
subject to relevant embargo or sanction or to any entity or person for which an
export license is required per any relevant restricted party list, without
first obtaining a license. Furthermore, You hereby agree that You will not use
or allow use of Controlled Technology in connection with chemical, biological,
or nuclear weapons, or missiles, drones or space launch vehicles capable of
delivering such weapons. Symantec shall have the right to suspend performance
of any of its obligations under this Agreement, without any prior notice being
required and without any liability to Customer, if You fail to comply with this
provision.

party, nor do they have any authority to bind the other party by contract or
otherwise to any obligation.
