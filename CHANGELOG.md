### v4.1.2 (2020-10-01):

- Creates config instance via Config.createInstance() to pass to agent instead of using Config.initialize().

  Previously, the agent and created segments could end up with different config instances resulting in config updates (such as attribute configuration) not propagating correctly for tests. Now, the agent uses the same initialized singleton similar to regular execution.

### v4.1.1 (2020-09-16):

- Improved handling of soft-matching segments for cases where siblings have duplicate names.

### v4.1.0 (2020-09-03):

- Added TestAgent.getAgentApi() function that returns an agent API instance for the underlying agent instance.

### v4.0.0 (2020-07-21):
- Updated to Apache 2.0 license.
- Bumped minimum dev dependency of newrelic (agent) to 6.11 for license matching.
- Updated metric retrieval from agent for `assert.metrics` to match newer agent versions.

  **Breaking:** assertions are now only compatible with newrelic (agent) versions 6+.
- Added third party notices file and metadata for dependencies.
- Updated readme with more detail.
- Added issue templates for bugs and enhancements.
- Added code of conduct file.
- Added contributing guide.
- Added pull request template.
- Migrated CI to GitHub Actions.
- Added copyright headers to all source files.
- Added .vscode to .gitignore.
- Added additional items to .npmignore.

### v3.3.0 (2020-05-20):

- Added the ability to skip tests using multiple keywords

### v3.2.0 (2019-11-12):

- Added new format for versioned test

  Dependency version may now be sampled down to a constant number of versions.
  For example:
  ```
  "dependencies": {
    "redis": {
      "versions": ">1.0.0",
      "samples": 10
    }
  }
  ```

### v3.1.0 (2019-09-03):

- Added `--skip` flag to allow for skipping certain test suites.

### v3.0.0 (2019-01-07):

- Added `setState` argument to `TestAgent` constructor, which allows for
automatic data collection in tests by default.

- Removed obsoleted `flags` argument from `TestAgent` constructor. Feature
flags are now accounted for in standard config.

### v2.0.1 (2018-11-06):

- Versioned test runner now uses `--no-package-lock` when installing test deps.

### v2.0.0 (2018-10-26):

- Dropped support for Node 0.10 and Node 0.12.

- Added `isLocalhost` and `getDelocalizedHostname` to utilities methods.

  These methods are useful for determining the host name as the New Relic agent
  sees it. When making metrics and event attributes, the delocalized hostname is
  what the agent will use.

### v1.2.1 (2018-07-10):

- Fixed default messages for tap assertions.

### v1.2.0 (2018-02-26):

- Added check for `AGENT_PATH` environment variable.

  This environment variable can be used to specify the location of the `newrelic`
  package that these test utilities will load. It should be the path to the root
  directory of the agent. If the environment variable is not set, then the
  `newrelic` module that was installed (e.g. is in a `node_modules` directory)
  is used instead.

- With this change, the following syntaxes are now valid:

  * `versioned-tests`: Will look for tests with the following globs:
    * `test/versioned/**/package.json`
    * `tests/versioned/**/package.json`
    * `node_modules/**/tests/versioned/**/package.json` <-- For the agent to
      seamlessly work with the tests of deps!
  * `versioned-tests test/versioned/hapi`: Will look with these globs:
    * `test/versioned/hapi/package.json`
    * `test/versioned/hapi/**/package.json`
  * `versioned-tests test/versioned/mongodb/package.json`: Will look only at:
    * `test/versioned/mongodb/package.json`

### v1.1.2 (2018-02-23):

- Added `agent#registerInstrumentation` method to registering third-party
  instrumentations in a testing environment.

### v1.1.1 (2018-02-23):

- Fixed invalid `TestAgent.extendTap` reference in `index.js` to `assert.extendTap`.

### v1.1.0 (2018-02-20):

- Added `TestAgent#registerInstrumentation` method.

  This method allows third-party instrumentations to be registered in a test environment.

### v1.0.0 (2018-02-20):

- Added `TestAgent` helper class.

  This class provides simple to use helpers for running your tests with the agent
  and in transactions.

- Added `tap` assertions.

  If your tests use [`tap`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tap), then you can add
  some helpful assertions to your tests using this module.

- Added version matrix test running.

  This is a script for executing your instrumentation's tests against many
  versions of the module you are instrumenting.
